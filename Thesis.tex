\chapter*{Abstract} 
This thesis presents a comprehensive study on the maneuver performance, modeling, and control strategies of an eVTOL aircraft, focusing on its ability to operate safely and efficiently in various flight conditions. The research leverages MBDyn, a multibody dynamics software, to develop a detailed airframe model that captures the six degrees of freedom inherent to eVTOL operations. 

The study is structured into three main chapters, each addressing a distinct yet interrelated aspect of eVTOL aircraft performance. Chapter 1 introduces the fundamental principles of MBDyn and discusses the setup and validation of the airframe model. Chapter 2 outlines the integration process between MBDyn and Simulink, detailing the control system architecture and its response to various maneuvers. Chapter 3 evaluates the maneuver performance of the eVTOL aircraft under gust wind conditions, adhering to ADS-33 guidelines, to ensure the aircraft's handling qualities and controllability.

The research contributes to the field by providing an advanced airframe modeling framework, a robust control system integration methodology, and a thorough evaluation of maneuver performance. These contributions are significant for the design and control of future eVTOL aircraft, offering insights that can enhance flight safety and operational capability.

The thesis concludes with recommendations for adopting advanced modeling tools, enhancing control system integration, and conducting rigorous performance testing. It emphasizes the importance of these strategies in advancing the aerospace engineering field and the development of autonomous flight systems.

%\chapter*{Sommario} 
%Questa tesi presenta uno studio esaustivo sulle prestazioni di manovra, modellazione e strategie di controllo di un aeromobile eVTOL, focalizzandosi sulla sua capacità di operare in modo sicuro ed efficiente in varie condizioni di volo. La ricerca si avvale di MBDyn, un software di dinamica multibody, per sviluppare un dettagliato modello di cellula aerodinamica che cattura i sei gradi di libertà intrinseci alle operazioni eVTOL.

%Lo studio è strutturato in tre capitoli principali, ognuno dei quali affronta un aspetto distinto ma interrelato delle prestazioni dell'aeromobile eVTOL. Il Capitolo 1 introduce i principi fondamentali di MBDyn e discute l'impostazione e la convalida del modello di cellula aerodinamica. Il Capitolo 2 illustra il processo di integrazione tra MBDyn e Simulink, dettagliando l'architettura del sistema di controllo e la sua risposta a varie manovre. Il Capitolo 3 valuta le prestazioni di manovra dell'aeromobile eVTOL in condizioni di vento rafficato, attenendosi alle linee guida ADS-33, per garantire le qualità di gestione e la controllabilità dell'aeromobile.

%La ricerca contribuisce al settore fornendo un framework avanzato per la modellazione della cellula aerodinamica, una metodologia robusta per l'integrazione del sistema di controllo e una valutazione approfondita delle prestazioni di manovra. Questi contributi sono significativi per la progettazione e il controllo dei futuri aeromobili eVTOL, offrendo spunti che possono migliorare la sicurezza dei voli e la capacità operativa.

\chapter*{Introduction}

The advent of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has ushered in a new era of aerial missions, particularly in urban environments, where complex maneuvers and stability are paramount. While various UAV types have emerged, multicopter stand out for their inherent instability, requiring sophisticated low-level stability control modules that have evolved into fully autonomous flight controllers over recent years. Rotary UAVs, in particular, have garnered interest for their versatility in missions ranging from short-range parcel delivery to close-range infrastructure inspection and even recreational drone racing.

Despite extensive research in UAV control focusing on optimal control, obstacle detection, and autonomous navigation, there remains a significant gap in quantifying the high maneuverability and agility of small UAVs, particularly multicopter. As these vehicles evolve to different scales, maintaining agility becomes crucial for tasks such as countering turbulence and gusts, especially in confined areas during close-range inspections. Consequently, there's a pressing need for an objective test procedure to quantify a small UAV's maneuverability and agility, facilitating comparisons between prototypes and existing models.

Although multicopter are widely adopted for their ease of use and affordability, they lack endurance for long-range missions, which has led to the exploration of fixed-wing UAVs. However, the requirement for a runway limits their applicability. Engineers have bridged this gap with the vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) configuration, combining the advantages of multicopter and fixed-wing UAVs. VTOL UAVs can take off and land vertically, hover, and cover long ranges due to their wings, making them increasingly popular in both civilian and military domains \cite{DeMori2021}.

This thesis explores the integration of dynamics simulation using the MBDyn software with real-time control systems in Simulink to assess the maneuver performance of designed eVTOL drones. The computational aspects of general-purpose multibody simulation and recent improvements in MBDyn are discussed, highlighting the software's versatility in addressing various analysis needs, from real-time hardware-in-the-loop simulations to trajectory optimization. By combining simulation and control, this research aims to provide valuable insights into the maneuverability and agility of eVTOL drones, contributing to the advancement of UAV technology for diverse applications \cite{Zhang9460809}.

\section*{Background}
This thesis is the third part of the development of a VTOL UAV designed and built at Politecnico di Milano, Department of Aerospace Science and Technology (DAER). The initial design based on the basic requirements was presented in \cite{battaini2020}. The production and integration of the components, along with the development of a simulator, were carried out in \cite{martello2021}. The optimal structure, control system, and basic testing were completed in \cite{battaini2022}. This third thesis serves as the foundation for the present work, which involves building dynamics in MBDyn, simulating maneuvers, and optimizing the control system. The aircraft (figure \ref{fig:eVTOL UAV}) is an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicle powered by an 8500 mAh lithium-polymer battery that provides approximately 100 minutes of flight time. It is equipped with eight electric motors for vertical flight and two for forward flight. The aircraft has a wingspan of 2.25 m and weighs 6.4 kg. A technical representation of the aircraft is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Technical drawings}.
